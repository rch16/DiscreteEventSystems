# EE4-57: Discrete Event Systems Coursework

This repository contains the code for my submission of my coursework for the EE4-57 Discrete Event Systems course at Imperial College London.

**Coursework Questions** - PDF highlighting tasks to be completed for the coursework

**Report** - PDF Report covering and explaining method and results.

**Coursework.m** - Main code for implementing coursework

**parallelComposition.m** - Function for computing the parallel composition of two automata

**partialObservability.m** - Function for converting an observable automata into a partially observable one

**observerAutomaton.m** - Function for computing the observer automaton

**verifyObserver.m** Function to compute the row sums, column sums and singular values of an observer matrix

**calculateState.m** Function to calculate the current state of an automaton, given its observer automaton and a sequence of events
